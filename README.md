# code-lab
A project containing starter templates to complete various coding challenges and katas.

# Motivation
Initial code will be used as a template for a Local Java project quickstart
that used Gradle for builds.

IntelliJ IDEA and 
Visual Studio Code are my local development environment code editors of choice, but any
editor may be used as no IDE-specific
files are checked into source control.

# Future
Eventually a GitHub Codespace or similar
remote Cloud-based VM can also use
this project as a starter template for a remote Java development environment.
